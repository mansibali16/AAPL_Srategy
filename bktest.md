# Backtesting Report: Algorithmic Trading Strategy

# 1. Overview

This report evaluates the performance of a simple algorithmic trading strategy based on an optimized XGBoost model for predicting stock price movement. The strategy places "buy" orders if the model predicts the stock price will increase the next day and "sell" orders if the model predicts a decrease.

# 2. Backtesting Setup

Stock Ticker: AAPL (Apple Inc.)

Data Period: January 1, 2021 - March 1, 2024

Transaction Cost: 0.1% per trade

Performance Metrics: Cumulative Returns, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown

Benchmark: Buy & Hold Strategy

# 3. Strategy Performance vs. Buy & Hold

The cumulative returns of the trading strategy significantly outperformed the buy & hold strategy over the backtesting period.

The maximum drawdown (-6.00%) suggests the strategy experienced lower downside risk compared to typical market fluctuations.

A Sharpe Ratio of 8.23 indicates strong risk-adjusted returns.

The ROC-AUC Score of 1.0 suggests that the model perfectly distinguishes between price increases and decreases, though this may indicate overfitting.

# 4. Observations & Insights

The strategy appears to perform exceptionally well with a high Sharpe ratio and limited drawdowns.

The perfect ROC-AUC score (1.0) suggests possible overfitting, meaning real-world results may differ from backtesting results.

The transaction cost (0.1%) was accounted for, yet the strategy still outperformed the benchmark.

# 5. Recommendations for Improvement

Regularization and Generalization: The model may be overfitting. Implementing cross-validation techniques and testing on an unseen dataset can improve robustness.

Risk Management Enhancements: Introduce stop-loss and position sizing strategies to reduce potential losses further.

Additional Features: Include sentiment analysis, volume indicators, or macroeconomic factors to enhance prediction accuracy.

Slippage Considerations: Further analysis should be conducted on the impact of slippage in real-world trading conditions.
